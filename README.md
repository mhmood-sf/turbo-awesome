## TODO

Restructure a little bit:
- Move basically ALL ui/widgets to cfg/base (maybe rename it cfg/widgets? or a
  new separate directory?).
- The configurations (alpha/gamma/etc.) then JUST import those widgets and USE
  them.

Because right now it's very confusing, how some widgets are in the cfg's own
directory, how some are in base, etc. etc.
